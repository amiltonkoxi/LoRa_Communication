## **2. Transmitter Setup**

### **2.1 Overview**
The **transmitter** sends simulated sensor data:
- **Force** (N).
- **Temperature** (Â°C).
- **Time** (s).

The data is transmitted as:

## **3. Receiver Setup**

### **3.1 Overview**
The **receiver** captures the transmitted data and calculates:
- **RSSI**: Received Signal Strength Indicator.
- **SNR**: Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

### 3.2 Formulas

**RSSI Calculation**:  
RSSI (dBm) = -(256 - RSSI)

**SNR Calculation**:  
SNR (dB) = P_signal (dBm) - P_noise (dBm)

## **4. Test Results**

### **4.1 Test Locations**
Experiments were conducted under **Line-of-Sight (LOS)** and **Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)** conditions, evaluating signal strength (RSSI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and packet loss at various distances.

1. **LOS and NLOS**:

### **4.2 Analysis of Results**

The following figures provide detailed insights into the experimental results under various conditions.

1. **RSSI Comparison Between LOS and NLOS**:  
   This figure compares RSSI values for LOS and NLOS conditions at the same distances. LOS conditions consistently exhibit stronger signals compared to NLOS, demonstrating the importance of maintaining line-of-sight for optimal communication.  
   ![Figure 1: RSSI Comparison](Figure_1.webp)

2. **RSSI vs Distance (NLOS Only)**:  
   This figure shows the decrease in RSSI (signal strength) as the distance increases in NLOS conditions. The results highlight the impact of obstacles and distance on signal attenuation.  
   ![Figure 2: RSSI (NLOS)](Figure_2.webp)

3. **SNR vs Distance (NLOS Only)**:  
   The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases as the distance increases in NLOS conditions. This decline indicates greater noise interference and weaker signal strength at longer distances.  
   ![Figure 3: SNR](Figure_3.webp)

4. **Percentage of Packets Received vs Distance (LOS and NLOS)**:  
   This graph compares the percentage of packets successfully received at different distances for both LOS and NLOS conditions. LOS exhibits a higher percentage of received packets, while NLOS shows increasing packet loss as the distance grows.  
   ![Figure 4: Packet Reception Percentage](Figure_4.webp)

5. **Path Loss vs Distance (NLOS Only)**:  
   This figure illustrates how path loss increases with distance in NLOS conditions. The results show significant signal attenuation due to obstacles, with higher path loss at longer distances.

## **5. How to Run the Project**

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the LoRa modules to the ESP32 as shown in the wiring diagram.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the **LoRa_E220** library in Arduino IDE.
   - Upload `Transmitter.ino` to the transmitter ESP32.
   - Upload `Receiver.ino` to the receiver ESP32.

3. **Monitor the Data**:

## **6. Troubleshooting**

- **"No Response from Device"**:
  - Verify wiring between ESP32 and LoRa module.
  - Ensure correct voltage levels (3.3V).

- **Weak Signal (RSSI)**:
  - Reposition the antennas for better alignment.
  - Increase transmission power in software configuration.
